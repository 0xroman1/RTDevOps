## Tarball.sh

This script is used to push files to an S3 bucket on the fly. It will create folders by date, so you can secure your opnotes/loot/files in the cloud without taking your eyes off the terminal. Alias the script and you can use it anywhere!

Requires AWS CLI installed and configured with access keys.
